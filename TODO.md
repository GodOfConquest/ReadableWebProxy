#TODO:

 - WattPad metadata filter.
 - Figure out how to selectively preserve some classes (I want to allow fontawesome content)

 FIXED:
 ## - Rule-caching is not working.
 ## - Multithreaded server fails because DB interface is shared across threads.
 ## - Validate unmatched keys in rules so that key-typos don't silently break things.
 ## funky tables outlines
