#TODO:

 - Figure out how to selectively preserve some classes (I want to allow fontawesome content)
add last updated field for most recemt release

 FIXED:
 ## - WattPad metadata filter.
 ## - Rule-caching is not working.
 ## - Multithreaded server fails because DB interface is shared across threads.
 ## - Validate unmatched keys in rules so that key-typos don't silently break things.
 ## - funky tables outlines
